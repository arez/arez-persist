# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Add a `scheduleAttach` static method to the generated sidecar will schedule the `attach` invocation using an arez `Task`. This is required when the component is potentially created within a read-only Arez transaction or a transaction that does not allow nested actions. This is particularly common when the peer is constructed insider a `@Memoize` annotated method.
