This library provides annotation driven infrastructure for persisting observable properties on
Arez components. The library has built-in support for storing properties in memory, within a browser
session or across browser sessions but allows users to supply their own mechanisms for persisting state.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use the library;

* add the following dependencies into the build system. i.e.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.realityforge.arez.persist</groupId>
   <artifactId>arez-persist</artifactId>
   <version>0.00</version>
</dependency>
```
